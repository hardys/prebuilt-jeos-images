# Prebuilt Heat JEOS Images

This repository contains images in the
[downloads section](https://github.com/heat-api/prebuilt-heat-jeos/downloads)
all JEOS images pre-built using the
[heat-jeos](https://github.com/heat-api/heat-jeos) toolchain.

This should help alleviate some problems people may be having with the
maintenance quality of libguest on various distributions when used with Oz.

Also, for those developers that develop inside a virtual machine, these
prebuilt images may be easier then building images on bare metal, as currently
required by Oz.
