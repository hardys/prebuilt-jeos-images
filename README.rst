Prebuilt Heat JEOS Images
=========================

This repository contains images in the
downloads section at ``https://github.com/heat-api/prebuilt-heat-jeos/downloads``
all JEOS images pre-built using the
heat-jeos toolchain contained at ``https://github.com/heat-api/heat-jeos).

This should help alleviate some problems developers and users may be having
with the maintenance quality of libguest on various distributions when used
with Oz.

Also, for those people that develop inside a virtual machine, these
prebuilt images may be easier then building images on bare metal, as currently
required by Oz.
